# Being-Social-Ha

## Description

This application is a social media backend that demonstrates all the api routes that the user can perform. This is a backend only app which means there is no front end and therefore no deployment to heroku. Creating this app utilized some new technologies such as mongoDB and mongoose as well as express as always to handle the routes.
